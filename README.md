
1.How long did you spend on the coding test and how would you improve your solution if you had more time? (If you were unable to spend as much time as you would have liked on the coding test, use your answer as an opportunity to explain what you would add). 

I have spent around 2 hours in coding the assignment. If I had more time, I would focus on moving the data to json file and write test cases to test. Also add better styles and improve the design. I would improve the performance of the website. I would also add more refinement functionalities - for example: refine with time

2. Describe the tooling / libraries / packages you chose to use for your development process and the reasons why. 

Used ng2-search-filter mechanism for better enhanced look and output of search

3. Describe how this solution would be deployed and run in your chosen cloud provider and any impact this may have on its development.

Solution would be deployed to Azure portal using app service
 
4. If the application was enhanced to contain business sensitive data what considerations and possible solutions would you consider for securing it? 

Security algorithms like SHA512 will be implemented.

5. How would you track down a performance issue in production and what was your last experience of this? 

Developer tools are my best friend in these cases, profilers and some other helpers like re-render highlight can save a life. Yes, I had performance issues in the past and the chrome tool profiler helped a lot finding the solution. There were lots of unnecessary loops together with memory leaks, which was easily detectable looking into the call stack and the profiler.
